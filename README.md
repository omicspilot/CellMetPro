# OmicsPilot: Cellular Metabolic Profiler (cellMetPro)

**Visualize and explore cellular metabolic states from scRNA-seq data**

A Python-based tool for biotech researchers to analyze and visualize metabolic profiles at single-cell resolution using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GEMs).

---

## Project Vision

Help researchers **visually explore the metabolic landscape** of their cells to identify biological targets for further investigation. Whether studying immune cells, cancer cells, or stem cells, OmicsPilot provides intuitive visualizations to spot metabolic signatures that distinguish cell populations.

## What This Tool Can Do

### Core Analysis Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Metabolic Scoring** | Compute reaction activity scores from gene expression using COMPASS algorithm |
| **Pathway Analysis** | Aggregate reactions into metabolic pathways and metareactions |
| **Cluster Comparison** | Statistical comparison of metabolic states between cell clusters |
| **Dimensionality Reduction** | PCA and UMAP projections of metabolic profiles |

### Visualization Capabilities

- **Metabolic UMAP/t-SNE**: Project cells based on metabolic activity rather than gene expression
- **Pathway Heatmaps**: Compare pathway activity across clusters or conditions
- **Reaction Dot Plots**: Visualize reaction scores with statistical significance
- **Volcano Plots**: Identify differentially active reactions between conditions
- **Metabolite Flow Diagrams**: Track metabolite uptake and secretion patterns
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Explore data with filtering and drill-down capabilities

## Background: FBA + GEMs + scRNA-seq

**Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)** predicts metabolic fluxes through a biochemical network by optimizing an objective function (e.g., biomass production) subject to stoichiometric constraints.

**Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GEMs)** are comprehensive reconstructions of an organism's metabolism, containing thousands of reactions and metabolites.

**COMPASS** (Characterizing Cell states through metabolic Profiling of the Transcriptome) integrates scRNA-seq data with GEMs to infer metabolic activity at single-cell resolution.

This tool brings these concepts together in an accessible visualization platform.
